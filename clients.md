                <br/>
                As part of a team I developed software to provision TV streaming services and network connections
                for the more than 1 million private customers of Norlys. I also helped migrating customers from various
                legacy billing systems to a new single corporate one.

                As part of a team I developed a Java EE backend application for corporate financial risk management.
                I then led the migration of this application to Quarkus and to run on OpenShift.

                <br/>
                I led the development of important and critical parts of the Danish eHealth system, which is a
                national backend system used in tele medical (home treatment) of patients with e.g. lung deceases,
                complicated pregnancies, and diabetes. I was lead developer for a distributed team based in Denmark and
                Ukraine which implemented REST and HL7 FHIR services based on Java, OpenAPI and Spring Boot.

                I was hired as an application architect and domain specialist to support green-field development of an
                application intended to run onboard a larger ship, to collect and analyse positional data from own ship
                (GPS) and other ships (AIS). The application detects near-miss situations in which another ship enters the
                ellipse shaped safety zone ahead of own ship, and makes these incidents available to other on-board system
                e.g. for post-trip analysis and trip evaluation performed by navigators and other bridge personel.<br/>
                <br/> The service is prepared to be available through the international Maritime Connectivity Platform
                (MCP).

                I was hired to upgrade an existing Java/JBoss-based system for editing and promulgation of
                navigational warnings for ships in the Baltic Sea and Danish territorial waters. The main task was to create
                a REST service to distribute navigational warnings in a format compliant with the IHO S-124 standard. 
                The service is part of an international programme, the Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP), and is used by ships at sea.

                exposed towards other Bankdata systems were documented using OpenAPI.

                I laid the architecture, served as team-lead and programmed major parts of the Core Credit API at
                Bankdata, which serves as an important REST-based API for a no. of other internal systems to get information
                about private customers and their financial situation. The Core Credit API was deployed as a no. of separate
                microservices.

                <br/>
                I led a group implementing a new credit granting system for private customers in 14 Danish banks. The work
                involved integration with internal and external data providers based on REST and SOAP protocols and a good
                ability of translating business requirements into working software. The work involved a large degree of
                communication and interaction with business consultants to ensure that the solution supported effective,
                low-labor, business processes.
