# Featured Projects

Selected freelance engagements across finance, telecom, healthcare, defence and maritime—spanning both greenfield delivery and modernization. I typically join as a senior freelancer to reduce risk, accelerate delivery (including responsible AI use), and ship production‑grade backend systems.

                <br/>
                On a cross‑functional team I built and integrated services for provisioning TV streaming and network connections for 1M+ customers.
                I also supported migrating customers from multiple legacy billing systems to a single corporate platform.

                <br/>
                I led development of critical parts of the Danish eHealth platform—a national backend used for telemedicine/home treatment
                (e.g. lung diseases, complicated pregnancies, and diabetes). I led a distributed team across Denmark and Ukraine delivering
                REST and HL7 FHIR services based on Java, OpenAPI and Spring Boot.

                <br/>
                As application architect and domain specialist, I supported greenfield development of an onboard service that collects and analyses
                positional data from own ship (GPS) and surrounding ships (AIS). The application detects near‑miss situations (another ship entering an
                ellipse‑shaped safety zone ahead of own ship) and makes incidents available to other onboard systems for post‑trip analysis and evaluation
                performed by navigators and other bridge personnel.<br/>
                <br/> The service was prepared for distribution via the international Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP).

                <br/>
                I upgraded an existing Java/JBoss-based system for editing and promulgation of navigational warnings.
                The main task was to create a REST service to distribute warnings in a format compliant with the IHO S‑124 standard.
                The service is part of the Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP) and is used by ships at sea.

                I implemented major parts of JMS- and REST-based integration points between Bankdata's internal systems and the public electronic deed register,
                which uses a complex SOAP‑over‑MQ protocol. APIs exposed towards other internal systems were documented using OpenAPI.

                <br/>
                As a remote freelancer I delivered a turnkey Node.js microservice that selects the optimum antenna for coast‑to‑ship communication,
                given a geographical description of each antenna's coverage area.

                <br/>
                I laid the architecture, served as team lead and implemented major parts of the Core Credit API—an important REST-based API used by multiple
                internal systems to access information about private customers and their financial situation. The Core Credit API was delivered as multiple microservices.

                <br/>
                I implemented a message archive based on Apache Cassandra to store ~2,500 AIS messages per second for five years and make this searchable using temporal and spatial query parameters.
